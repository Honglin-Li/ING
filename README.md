# ING Financial-Fairshare Challenge

The Simple Website is a demo created for the HerHackathon2023 activity organized by The Hackathon Company. It was developed within a 42-hour time frame.

The corresponding challenge for this project is the Financial-Fairshare Challenge set by ING. Our initial product plan includes the following steps:

Marketing Target: Our target audience is women who live with their partners. We plan to reach them through social media channels by pinpointing specific target groups.
Interested female users can visit the website to register for an account and try it out.
Users are required to input their own financial information, as well as their partner's financial details.

4. The website will display the user's current financial sharing status and provide a fair financial distribution scheme if any unfairness is detected.

5. This tool aims to initiate conversations between partners about their finances by highlighting any financial imbalances.

Future versions of the project may include the following enhancements:

The female user will have the ability to invite her partner to register and connect their account. Both parties will then fill in their financial information separately. The website will provide a calculation page to display the financial sharing status.

We plan to analyze financial downturns and propose potential financial sharing options for parents who may face new financial situations related to childcare and caregiving.

Taking into consideration the user's financial goals, such as savings, free time, and life-work balance, we will propose optimal financial sharing solutions. These solutions will be adjustable in real-time to cater to changing circumstances.
